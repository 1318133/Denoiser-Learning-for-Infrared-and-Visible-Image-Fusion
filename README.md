Pipeline of the proposed method. An efficient fusion network is used to generate fusion images in the generator, which is constrained by semantic adaptive measurement loss, intensity loss, and structural loss functions. In addition, the fusion image is injected with the noise of different intensities and input into different denoising networks (Denoiser-ir, Denoiser-vi) to restore them to images from different sources.
